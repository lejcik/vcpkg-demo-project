# vcpkg-demo-project

A demo project that demonstrates how to handle external dependencies (3rd party libraries) with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) tool.

There are two projects types, one for statically linked, and second one for dynamically linked libraries. Moreover, the project uses fixed baseline for libraries versions, in this case file `vcpkg.json` points to _vcpkg_ release tag `2022.01.31` (`b86c0c35b88e2bf3557ff49dc831689c2f085090`).
